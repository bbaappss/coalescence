      h1 About Coalescence
      h2 Our "Mini festo": 
      p We've created an outdoor experience unlike any other. 
      p Coalescence is a "choose your own adventure" style campout that is focused on disconnecting from technology and our daily lives so we can reconnect with ourselves, each other and nature. 
      p This camp out is for the curious beginner and the experienced outdoors person alike. 
      p Everyone has a chance to participate as much or as little as they want in activities put on by our teachers, sponsors, partners and other Coalescees. 
      p See our list of curated #[a.green(href="/activities.html" target="_blank") activities] here. 
      p Back at camp, enjoy music and art as we intertwine the two to create an intimate and immersive experience.

        )
      p We believe that radical contribution enhances everyone's experience, and ask that every Coalescee contribute in some shape or form. 
      p We've had people volunteer to lead activities, throw camp parties, showcase their talents, and assist with essentials like picking up trash. 
      p How can you and your camp add value to everyone’s weekend?

      p Coalescence believes in being stewards of the planet that makes these experiences possible, and strongly promotes simple conservation principles. 
      p We strive to perfect the art of the R’s – Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Repurpose, Recycle – and ask that you do your part to "leave no trace". 
      p Practicing these concepts helps ensure that our environment and finite natural resources are preserved for future appreciation and use.
