      h2 DISCONNECT TO RECONNECT
      p Coalescence is a choose-your-own-adventure style campout focused on celebrating nature through outdoor activities and fellowship. 
      p Try something new or show off your skills by hiking, climbing, kayaking, mountain biking, swimming, or practicing yoga. Over our three days together in the mountains, we can begin to reconnect with ourselves, each other, and with nature.

      h2 Radical Cooperation
      p Like anything in life, Coalescence is what you make it. 
      p We ask that every Coalescee contribute in some way — whether you’re leading an activity, picking up trash, helping coordinate a meal, organizing a gear exchange, or throwing a camp party, the magic of Coalescence doesn’t happen without you! 
      p As you prepare for the weekend, brainstorm how you can make the experience more special not only for yourself but for those you’ll be sharing it with.
